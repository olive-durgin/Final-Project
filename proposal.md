# Game Title
Mystery of Seona (demo)

## Repository
https://github.com/olive-durgin/Final-Project.git

## Description
I am going to code a text-based, choose your own adventure with turn-based fights, a story that changes with the choices that you make, and characters with unique strengths and abilities.

## Features
- Feature 1: Imported Fight Mechanic
	- A turn-based fighting code that is imported into the main code and restarts everytime the player loses.
- Feature 2: Item Inventory
	- An inventory that stores the players's items via a list.
- Feature 3: Unique characters.
	- Each character has a different skill set/strengths that affect the game.

## Challenges
- I need to research how to make a loop that asks for an integer as an input and does not crash when a non-numerical value is input.
- I need to do more research on having the characters personality/abilities affect and change the story without having to copy and paste huge sections of the script.
- Fixing any/all import bugs for custom scripts since when working on CYOA scripts in the past, there have been many issues with this.

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- The ideal outcome for the final product of this project is a fully functional text-based, interactive CYOA game.

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- The bare minimum that I want this project to be is to have no bugs and all loops and fight mechanics work properly.
